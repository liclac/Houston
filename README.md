Houston
=======

Houston is an experimental issue tracker, designed to make bug reporting quick and simple, and to encourage a community to report bugs.

Design Goals
------------
* Make reporting simple
	* Anyone can find a bug, so anyone should be able to report them
	* People should /want/ to file bugs, this benefits everyone
* Eliminate the learning curve
	* Make the UI as simple and well-explained as possible
	* No long manual pages to read, or lingo to learn
* Eliminate signup and invite formalities
	* Registration in a few clicks
	* Ability to sign in with Twitter
* No prior knowledge of the team structure should be necessary
	* Assign bugs to "the code guys" or "the design guys" and let them assign them to specific people

Why another bug tracker?
------------------------
1. "Houston" is too perfect of a name for an Issue Tracker
2. Most issue trackers on the market either suck (Mantis) or run on Ruby (Redmine)
   * And after seeing a certain company's issue tracker dying on a daily basis due to running out of RAM, I'm not having any Ruby on my server
3. All of these are aimed towards companies with a dedicated QA division (and where everyone on a project knows each other)
4. Why not?
